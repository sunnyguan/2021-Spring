# CS 2340

## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course introduces the concepts of computer architecture by going through multiple levels of abstraction, the numbering systems and their basic computations. It focuses on the instruction-set architecture of the MIPS machine, including MIPS assembly programming, translation between C and MIPS, and between MIPS and machine code. General topics include performance calculations, processor datapath, pipelining, instruction level parallelism, and memory hierarchy, including cache memories.
