# CS 2340

## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course introduces the concepts of computer architecture by going through multiple levels of abstraction, the numbering systems and their basic computations. It focuses on the instruction-set architecture of the MIPS machine, including MIPS assembly programming, translation between C and MIPS, and between MIPS and machine code. General topics include performance calculations, processor datapath, pipelining, instruction level parallelism, and memory hierarchy, including cache memories.

### General

Reference notes file: **Assembler.pdf** (on eLearning)

Course will be using **MIPS**.

### Computer Architecture: 

**ISA**: Instruction Set Architecture

- **RAM** (Random Access Memory) communicates with the **CPU** as well as the storage disks
- **CPU** contains **registers** and **data path**
- **Von Neumann Principle** states that instructions and data resides in RAM (invented by Alan Turing)
- The larger the size, the slower the speed

### MIPS RAM Memory Layout

- Reserved
- Stack $\Lra$ Dynamic Data $\Longleftarrow$ Heap
- Static data
- Text
- Reserved

### Instruction Execution

- **Data**: flows between Memory and CPU (both ways)
- **Instructions**: only flows from **Memory** to CPU
- MIPS uses 32-bit integer registers $\Lra$ 16 Double long floating point
- Loop process (infinite loop, Instruction Fetch Cycle)
    1. Fetch instruction from RAM (Program Counter)
    2. Increment PC
    3. Execute instruction (may change PC)
    4. **ONLY** terminated by interrupts from outside source

### Registers

There are 32 registers, and each of them are 32 bits long. All ALU instructions have 3 addresses and each is 5 bits, for example:

```SQL
ADD $1, $2, $3
```

There are many reserved registers so be careful when choosing them. 

### Types of Instructions

1. **R-Type** (ALU functions): op, rs, rt, rd (result), shamt, funct
    1. Shift, add, multiply, divide, etc.
2. **I-Type** (loads and stores): op, rs, rt (result), imm
    1. Must load data before operating on them
    2. Store result back in store operation
    3. Around 20% of operations are I-Type
3. **J-Type** (unconditional branch): op, addr
    1. Jump somewhere

### Clock Cycle

All RISC instructions take one **clock cycle** to execute.

Execution example:

(Note: `Mem`=read from memory, `WB`=Write Back to memory)

```
IF -> ID -> IX -> Mem -> WB (I300)
      IF -> ID -> IX -> Mem -> WB (I301)
            IF -> ID -> IX -> Mem -> WB (I302)
```

Split instructions into smaller chunks so each can execute in one clock cycle. However, there are issues relating to dependencies between different instructions which causes delays. Goal is to get maximum throughput through the MIPS pipeline.

Coming up next: performance evaluation and some Law.
