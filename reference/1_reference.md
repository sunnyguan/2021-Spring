# Reference

This document will keep track of the various tools that I use in my Markdown files to generate cool stuff. Compare the generated PDF as well as the raw Markdown file (make sure to click the `raw` button on Github and not use the built-in viewer).

For example, to get a simple orange box with an orange title, you can use this:

:::orange
\boxtitle{orange}{Title}

Some text here
:::

There is also the option to add in a colored "subtitle":

:::green
\boxtitle{green}{Theorem} \boxsubtitle{green}{1.12}

$1+1=2$
:::

Other colors:

:::red
\boxtitle{red}{Warning}

Warning!
:::

:::blue
\boxtitle{blue}{Definition}

Some definition
:::

:::pink
\boxtitle{pink}{Example}

For example
