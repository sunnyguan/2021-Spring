# Spring 2021

This repository will (hopefully) keep track of my notes for the Spring 2021 semester. I'll also try to document any revisions I make for future reference.

## Initial Setup

Each folder contains the relevant notes for one class. Notes are written in Markdown with LaTeX added in if necessary. 

- Editor: Neovim 0.5.0
- PDF Compiler: Pandoc
- PDF Viewer: Skim

More details on how I setup my environment will be posted on my dotfiles repository *in the near future*. My goal is to have a working setup that satisfies 95% of my use cases, while being flexible enough to test out both minor revisions as well as major overhauls of certain components.

### Folder Structure

In each folder, there should be these files:

- `0_header.md`: header file for this course
- Less than 10 `md` files: actual note files, may or may not be split since Markdown supports folding
- `COURSENAME.pdf`: compiled PDF of notes

Hopefully this will be a successful journey; feel free to send me a message or open an issue if you have any questions!
