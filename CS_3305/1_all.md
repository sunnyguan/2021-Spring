## Day 1: 1/19

### Why Discrete?

**Rigorous understanding of algorithms**: Proving the correctness of algorithms and verify that their performance is as expected.

**Time complexity and space complexity**: space complexity is also important because RAM can only hold so much information before slowing down (due to accessing hard drive for swapping)

### Asymptotic Bound

1. **Big-O**: Upper bound of complexity
2. **Big-Omega**: Lower bound
3. **Big-Theta**: Tight bound, set intersection of **Big-O** and **Big-Theta**

### Modular Arithmetic

$a \equiv b \mods m \Longleftrightarrow a \mod m = b \mod m \Longleftrightarrow (a-b) \equiv 0 \mods m$

### Representation of Numbers

- **Decimal**: 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
- **Binary**: 0, 1
- **Hexadecimal**: 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

Binary multiplying by power of 2

$5_{10}=101_2 \Lra 10_{10}=1010_2 \Lra 20_{10}=10100_2$

Bit shift left for multiplying by 2, bit shift right for dividing (truncate) by 2.

### Prime and Composite Numbers

**Prime**: only 2 factors, 1 and itself

**Composite**: more than 2 factors

:::definition
**Sieve of Eratosthenes**

Discard multiples of prime numbers to *sieve* through set of all numbers less than $n$.

```python
def primes_less_than_n(n):
    primes = set([i for i in range(2, n + 1)])
    for i in range(int(sqrt(n))):
        if i in primes:
            j = 2
            while i * j <= n:
                primes.discard(i * j)
                j += 1
    return primes
```

### Induction and Recursion

- **Recursion**: express problem as smaller instances
- **Induction**: used to prove recursion solutions
- **Strong Induction**: induction based on all previous steps rather than just the one previous step
